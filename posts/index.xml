      <description>My First Post! If I&amp;rsquo;ve learned anything from my first few years as a developer, it&amp;rsquo;s that I can retain half as much of the information as I&amp;rsquo;d like, and I know less than half of what I need to know in order to be the engineer that I want to be. It&amp;rsquo;s the small things that matter in life, and I like to think that applies to software engineering as well.</description>
