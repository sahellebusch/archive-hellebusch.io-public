      <description>Opinion: Passing Variables Is Better Than Proxy Injection The Issue A common issue I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced while developing Node servers is how to best inject mocks for tests. Libraries like proxyquire override the require function and act as a pass-through proxy. This is achieved by overriding the require function and using a custom loader based on the injected module paths. Seems straightforward enough, but I&amp;rsquo;ve seen complicated examples with nested injections that invalidate the module cache from suite to suite, thus resulting in false positives.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m Sean, a software engineer, avid backpacker, novice photographer, improv cook, and disc golf enthusiast. I grew up in Saint Louis, Missouri and attended college at Truman State University. After migrating to Kansas City for work, and meeting my wonderful partner, Kelly, we picked up our things and headed to the Pacific Northwest. Portland is where we call home now; where the beards grow long, the beer flows hazy, and the trees are ever green.</description>

      <description>My First Post! If I&amp;rsquo;ve learned anything from my first few years as a developer, it&amp;rsquo;s that I can retain half as much of the information as I&amp;rsquo;d like, and I know less than half of what I need to know in order to be the engineer that I want to be. It&amp;rsquo;s the small things that matter in life, and I like to think that applies to software engineering as well.</description>
